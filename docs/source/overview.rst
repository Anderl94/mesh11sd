The Mesh11sd project
********************

 Mesh11sd is a dynamic parameter and configuration daemon for 802.11s mesh networks running on the OpenWrt operating system.

 It was originally designed to leverage 802.11s mesh networking at Captive Portal venues.
 This is the open source version and it enables easy and automated mesh network operation with multiple mesh nodes.

 This version does not require a Captive Portal to be running.
